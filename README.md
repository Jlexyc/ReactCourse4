# ReactCourse4

# Homework #1 (Functional Components)

UI is on you.

- Create a web app, that will work with ToDo list (add/remove/edit items). Also each item could have its own status (Open, In Progress, Done). So we need to implement a mechanism that allows us to change status of the task.
- Add an ability to filter tasks by status.
- Add an ability to sort items by Creation & Update dates.

Each task must have:
1. id
2. title
3. description
4. status
5. creation date
6. update date

# Homework #2 (Redux)

- Rebuild your Homework 1 with Redux
- Add and setup eslint to your project

# Homework #3 (Thunk + Fetch)

Create a React App that will be fetching and updating data remotely on the BE.

You need to implement:
- List of goods
- Filter goods by the string (locally)
- Sort goods by the field asc/desc (locally)
- Update item
- Remove Item
- Add Item

Use BE app from https://github.com/Jlexyc/bff-react to run service locally
