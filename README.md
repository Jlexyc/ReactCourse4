# Homework #1 (Functional Components)

UI is on you.

- Create a web app, that will work with ToDo list (add/remove/edit items). Also each item could have its own status (Open, In Progress, Done). So we need to implement a mechanism that allows us to change status of the task.
- Add an ability to filter tasks by status.
- Add an ability to sort items by Creation & Update dates.

Each task must have:
1. id
2. title
3. description
4. status
5. creation date
6. update date
